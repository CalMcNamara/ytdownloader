The goal of this segment of code was to be able to contiously copy the links. However, the issue that I was facing 
was that it would only copy one link and would contiously add that one link for the .append. What I found was that during
the var = copy_clipboard() it was calling the function that one time at the start of the application and would not recall it
Solution.
I created a function that stored the var assignment and the .append I then called this function every time I needed to
add a link to the list.
